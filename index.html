            <p>In a world of introverts, extroverts and ambiverts, I did not know a 4th kind existed. Amberverts are a critically endangered species, the last surviving member was seen somewhere between Bovaconti and the Mayor's office. However, there have been documents pointing to their presence all over the globe, given their passion for travel.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you ever meet one, be prepared for a high octane action sequence. One moment you'll be doing Bachata and in the next you'll found yourself being yeeted with martials arts. Their only weakness, however, is a very particular kind of tickle. The kind in which you only have to mention the word "tickle" while standing 3 feet away and VOILA, they collapse like a cookie that's been dunked for too long.</p>
            <br>
            <p>They deadass put the extra in the word <i>extraordinary</i>, no cap. I am more than delighted to be a part of this study and would love to know Amber more. kthanksbye</p>
